    "\"I think you're better off finding the money to hire someone than actually find a co-founder. The main reason? You probably won't find someone as passionate as you are about the organization you're building. And keep in mind, I have no clue who you are or what you're building so that's no judgment on you or the idea, just the reality I've observed over 20 years of startups.\"",
